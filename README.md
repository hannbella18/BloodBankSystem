### 🩸Project Summary — Blood Bank Database System (CSC3402)

Developed a **web-based Blood Donation Management System** to streamline the process of donor registration, appointment scheduling, and blood inventory tracking. The system features a secure login for donors and employees, enabling profile management, donation history tracking, and centralized data access.

The project was built using a **relational database design** supported by a robust **DBMS architecture (MVC model)** to ensure data integrity, security, and efficiency. Donor and staff data were protected using encrypted storage and controlled access mechanisms.

My role focused on designing and implementing the **Guest Login module** using **HTML and database integration**, collaborating closely with teammates on ERD design, database schema, and interface prototypes (via GoodNotes).

This system enhances the efficiency and reliability of blood donation operations by providing a user-friendly platform for both donors and administrators.
